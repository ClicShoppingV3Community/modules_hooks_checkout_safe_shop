Safe.Shop The Global Ecommerce Trustmark & Reviews

An online store with a review system, Global Code of Conduct certification, Trust Score and Trust Badges in place will increase the level of confidence online visitors have in their shopping experience, and in turn will lead to increased conversion and order size.
Safe.Shop integrates the Consumer Review System with which you can easily collect consumers reviews that you can display on your online shop, all of which is integrated directly onto your website with no need to for the consumer to visit another website.
By showing the Safe.Shop Trustmark on your online shop, you are demonstrating to potential customers your reliability. If needed, we mediate with consumers in case of conflicts and provide you with the necessary (legal) support.

How Safe.Shop works
1) Set up the Safe.Shop Trustmark. Takes up to 5 minutes and can give you a sales boost of up to 20%.
2) An order is received: A customer buys from your online store.
3) Personal invites: You can use Safe.Shop to send review invitations using excel or just send the review invitation from your own email. 
4) Automated Invites: Safe.Shop can automatically send a review invitation to your customer a few days after the order has been placed. 
5) Customer reviews: Your customer can give your online shop a review directly via email, your own website or via Safe.Shop.
6) Alerts: Can be set for when a new review is added or only in case of negative feedback. You decide.
7) Manage your reviews: Learn from customer reviews using our dashboard as well as report misuse or request moderation when necessary.
8) Turn negative reviews into positive ones: We withhold negative reviews for 14 days, offering you the opportunity to contact unhappy customers and turn negative feedback into positive ones.

Display the Safe.Shop Trustmark for free on your website
 
You can show the Safe.Shop Trustmark for free on your website if you have a positive Trust Score. Our Artificial Intelligence algorithm determines your trust score on more than 40+ criteria including the availability of contact details on your online shop, payment methods offered, consumer reviews and much more. Our algorithm continuously adds more factors to separate reliable online shops from poor performing online stores and scams.
 
Our freemium model is suitable both for small as well as large enterprises. However, if your business requires additional support in the form of moderation requests, invitations sent via our system or online dispute resolution we can also help through our paid service tiers.
